# power-of-two-max-heap
A Java implementation of a novel priority queue: the Power-of-Two Max Heap. Unlike a binary heap, each parent has 2^k children, where k is configurable. The structure maintains the max-heap property and supports efficient insert and popMax operations. Designed for performance benchmarking and scalability testing.
